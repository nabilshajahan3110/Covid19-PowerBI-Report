Power BI dashboard and report providing detailed analysis of COVID 19 pandemic.
CREATED BY: NABIL MOHAMMED SHAJAHAN
In this report, we will be examining the COVID-19 pandemic that broke out in 2020. This report has utilized datasets made available from January-July 2020 which outlines confirmed cases, recovered cases, and deaths. These datasets have been geographically differentiated to WHO regions and countries. Additionally, these datasets also track the pandemic spread in terms of each country, number of cases and events reported per day, and so on. This report also utilizes a comprehensive report of the pandemic which provides final figures from each country and region, total cases, total recovered, and total deaths.

OVERVIEW
Two measures created: Death Rate(%) and Recovery Rate(%).
Three new columns created: Death Rate, Recovery Rate, and Total Tests Rate.

FINDINGS
The greatest number of cases were reported in the Americas region (10 million), which is staggeringly higher compared to other regions in the list. The number of recovered cases and deaths are also higher than their neighbours. Significantly higher number of tests were also undertaken in this region.
There was a steep rise in number of deaths from March. Consequently, recovery and new cases also were on the rise. This finding coincides to the real-life reports of the pandemic growing exponentially then, triggering many countries to impose nationwide lockdowns and severe travel restrictions.
The general trendline depicts the rise in numbers across all categories globally, which suggests the second wave of the pandemic which was exponentially more rampant and swifter.
A discrepancy in this data comes from the numbers reported in the South-East Asia region, which does not report numbers from China. Considering their huge population and being the point of origin of COVID-19, this lack of information severely affects the accuracy of this data.
